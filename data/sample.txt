The so-called CSV (Comma Separated Values) format is the most common import and export format for spreadsheets and
databases. CSV format was used for many years prior to attempts to describe the format in a standardized way in RFC
4180. The lack of a well-defined standard means that subtle differences often exist in the data produced and consumed
by different applications. These differences can make it annoying to process CSV files from multiple sources. Still,
while the delimiters and quoting characters vary, the overall format is similar enough that it is possible to write
a single module which can efficiently manipulate such data, hiding the details of reading and writing the data from
the programmer.
